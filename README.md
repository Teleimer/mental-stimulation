FlashCard APP

Project Overview
This repository contains a work-in-progress flashcard application designed to optimize long-term 
retention through specialized study algorithms.

The project is split into two areas.

* SwiftUI Application: The primary mobile interface 

* Logic & Architecture: A collection of Python-based modules (developed in Spyder) used to verify data structures, 
statistical modeling, and algorithmic logic.

Tech Stack
* Frontend: SwiftUI (iOS)

* Logic/Backend Research: Python 3.12 (Statistics & Data Modeling, Up)

* AI Integration: Gemini Pro API (Upcoming), for optional voice analysis to grade answers

* Interface engagement through hand-worn ring with rollerball (upcoming) to facilitate drilling of knowledge without
needing to look at phone. 

* Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Current Status: Work in Progress

* This project is an active portfolio piece. I am currently building out the remainder of the drill logic in python.
* Actively working on implementing front-end development through SWIFT.

Recent Milestones:
* Defined core Flashcard and Deck data models in Python.

* Established SwiftUI layout for card viewing, deck selection, course selection, and addition of new instances 
of each.

Upcoming Features:
* Gemini API integration for analysis of voice inputs to grade responses.

* Statistical dashboard to track learning progress over time.

* Alternate engagement with the app through ring-based interaction
